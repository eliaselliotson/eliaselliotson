# Hi there!

My name's Eli, and I'm a 16 year old developer from Canada!

I work for a programmer named Benjamin Robinson, where I'm privileged to work with [Advice On Wealth](https://adviceon.com) to maintain and create websites for their financial advisors.  I also used to work for a small incorporation called _Cracklecat Inc._ where I got to work on the the _Moo To Do_ app by [CATTLEytics](https://www.cattleytics.com/).

I am blessed to be able to serve my God and my church family by using my gift of building web applications.  I've been able to create a slides app for my youth group, as well as create a custom Bible reading app for one of my brothers in Christ.

I'm constantly learning tons of new things, such as physics, networking, the rendering pipeline, data compression, web design, and much more.  I'm hoping to one day learn binary operations, vectors and linear algebra, fragment shaders, and calculus.
